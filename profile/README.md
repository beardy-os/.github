## Custom Operating System images based on Fedora

This is a collection of container images using Fedora's [support for OCI/Docker containers as a transport and delivery mechanism for operating system content](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainerStable).

Our ultimate goal is to provide a community-curated set of images to take something great and make it awesome.
